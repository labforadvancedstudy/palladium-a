# Bootstrap v1 (Archive)

This directory contains the first bootstrap attempt for Palladium. These files are archived for historical reference.

## Structure

- `archive/` - Various early compiler attempts
- `core/` - Core compiler components (lexer, parser, codegen, type checker)
- `demos/` - Demonstration programs
- `utilities/` - Helper utilities (AST builder, module system, string builder)

## Status

This bootstrap attempt was superseded by:
1. `bootstrap/v2_full_compiler/` - Full-featured compiler approach
2. `bootstrap/v3_incremental/` - Incremental tiny compiler approach (successful)

The v3 incremental approach ultimately achieved 100% self-hosting capability.
