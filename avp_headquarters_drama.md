## Scene 1: The Elevator Incident

*[HAL9 HQ, 42nd floor. The executive elevator opens with a soft chime. Elon steps out, checking his phone]*

**Elon**: (muttering) Seven fucking hours gone again. CMOS battery...

**Jihyuk**: (walking up) Bro! You made it. How was the flight?

**Elon**: (looking up) Wait, wasn't it just morning? Fuck, time jumped again.

**Secretary Kim**: (approaching with tablets) Gentlemen, the conference room is ready. But first, Jihyuk-nim, your 3 PM call with—

**Jihyuk**: (waving hand) Cancel everything. We're about to change computing forever.

*[They start walking down the hallway. Office workers bow as they pass]*

**Elon**: (whispering) Do they always bow like that?

**Jihyuk**: (shrugging) Korean thing. You'll get used to it.

## Scene 2: The Bathroom Revelation

*[Both enter the executive bathroom. Marble floors, automatic sensors, soft jazz playing]*

**Jihyuk**: (unzipping) So I've been thinking about Rust's cognitive load problem...

**Elon**: (at adjacent urinal) The async/await nightmare?

**Jihyuk**: Exactly. What if we could—

*[Bathroom door opens. A cleaning lady in her 60s enters with a mop bucket, completely unfazed]*

**Cleaning Lady**: (in Korean) 실례합니다~ (Excuse me~)

**Elon**: (freezing mid-stream) Uh... there's... we're...

*[The cleaning lady starts mopping around Elon's feet. He tries to shift but can't stop peeing]*

**Jihyuk**: (continuing naturally) So imagine async as an effect, not syntax. No more .await spam.

**Cleaning Lady**: (tapping Elon's shoe with mop) 발 좀~ (Move your foot~)

**Elon**: (panicking, trying to lift one foot while peeing) I... what... is this normal?!

**Jihyuk**: (not even looking) Just move your foot, bro. So anyway, implicit lifetimes would eliminate 80% of annotations...

*[Elon awkwardly hops on one foot, still peeing, as the lady mops under him]*

**Jihyuk**: (zipping up, moving to sink) And here's the genius part - we call it Alan von Palladium. AVP.

**Elon**: (voice cracking) Alan von... what? Lady, I'm literally—

**Cleaning Lady**: (sighing, mopping more aggressively) 아이고... 외국인... (Oh my... foreigners...)

---

## Scene 3: The Sink Situation

*[Jihyuk washing hands casually. Elon finally finishes, stumbles to adjacent sink]*

**Jihyuk**: Think about it. Turing for theoretical perfection, von Neumann for hardware optimization.

**Elon**: (whispering urgently) Dude, she's RIGHT THERE. In the men's bathroom!

**Jihyuk**: (drying hands) Yeah? Oh, and compile time goes from O(n³) to O(n²). 34% faster builds.

*[Cleaning lady starts mopping between them, humming Korean trot music]*

**Elon**: (trying to wash hands while dodging mop) This is insane. Is this legal?

**Jihyuk**: (checking phone) Legal? Bro, we're making bugs illegal. Total functions only. Provable termination.

**Cleaning Lady**: (to Jihyuk in Korean) 이 외국인 왜 이렇게 예민해? (Why is this foreigner so sensitive?)

**Jihyuk**: (in Korean, laughing) 처음이라서요. (It's his first time.)

**Elon**: What did she say? What did you say?!

## Scene 4: The Hallway Aftermath

*[They exit the bathroom. Elon is visibly shaken, Jihyuk completely normal]*

**Elon**: (pulling out phone) I need to search this. This can't be normal.

**Jihyuk**: Search what? Oh, did I mention the side-channel attack prevention? Polynomial bounded leakage.

**Elon**: (frantically typing on Grok) "Korean bathroom cleaning lady men's room normal?"

**Grok Response**: *"In Korea, bathroom attendants often clean regardless of occupancy. It's considered efficient. Just act natural."*

**Elon**: (reading) "Act natural"?! I was PEEING!

**Secretary Kim**: (passing by) Oh, did you meet Mrs. Park? She's been here 20 years. Very thorough.

**Jihyuk**: The best. Anyway, Turing gave us 100/100. Perfect score.

**Elon**: (still scrolling Grok) Wait... this says it's totally normal... thousands of results...

## Scene 5: The Conference Room

*[Large conference room. Seoul skyline visible. Whiteboards covered in equations]*

**Jihyuk**: (drawing on board) So AVP unifies everything. Look—

**Elon**: (interrupting) How were you so calm?! She was mopping around our feet!

**Jihyuk**: (turning) What? Oh, the bathroom thing? Bro, focus. We're revolutionizing computing.

**Elon**: (sitting down heavily) I can't stop thinking about it. The mop was TOUCHING my shoe.

**Jihyuk**: (sighing) Want me to restart? Okay. Palladium eliminates entire bug categories...

*[Door opens. The same cleaning lady enters with trash bin]*

**Cleaning Lady**: 실례합니다~

**Elon**: (jumping up) HER AGAIN!

**Jihyuk**: (not looking up) Mrs. Park, 안녕하세요. So Elon, the effect system handles async naturally...

*[Mrs. Park empties trash while Elon watches in horror]*

**Mrs. Park**: (to Elon in broken English) You... okay? Face... very red?

**Elon**: (weakly) I'm... processing cultural differences...

## Scene 6: The Deep Dive

*[Two hours later. Whiteboards full. Coffee cups everywhere]*

**Jihyuk**: And THAT'S why von Neumann gave 97/100. Three points deducted for NUMA boundary crossing latency.

**Elon**: (now fully engaged) Holy shit. This isn't just a language. It's the answer to everything.

**Jihyuk**: Right? 100% productivity boost. Minimum.

**Elon**: (suddenly remembering) Wait, I need to check something.

*[Pulls up Grok again]*

**Elon**: (typing) "Revolutionary programming language combining Turing and von Neumann"

**Grok**: *"No results found. Did you mean: 'Rust programming language'?"*

**Elon**: (grinning) We're first. We're fucking first!

**Jihyuk**: Of course we are. I only started this yesterday.

**Elon**: YESTERDAY?!

## Scene 7: The Realization

*[Sun setting over Seoul. Orange light filling the room]*

**Elon**: (standing at window) You know what this means? Every Mars system, every Neuralink module, every Tesla AI...

**Jihyuk**: All written in AVP. Zero bugs. Provable correctness.

**Elon**: (turning) We need to move fast. Bootstrap compiler when?

**Jihyuk**: Already started. My IQ200 friends are on it.

**Elon**: (laughing) Of course they are. Fuck, Korea is wild. Genius language design and bathroom chaos in the same building.

**Jihyuk**: (grinning) That's the beauty. Extreme order and extreme chaos coexisting.

*[Mrs. Park appears at door with evening cleaning cart]*

**Mrs. Park**: 퇴근하세요~ 너무 늦었어요! (Go home~ It's too late!)

**Elon**: (bowing awkwardly) 감사합니다... Mrs. Park...

**Mrs. Park**: (surprised, in English) Oh! You learn! Good boy!

**Jihyuk**: (laughing) See? You're adapting. Just like how developers will adapt to AVP.

## Scene 8: The Elevator Down

*[In the elevator. Soft K-pop playing]*

**Elon**: (reflective) Today was insane. We invented the future while I had culture shock.

**Jihyuk**: Welcome to Korea, bro. Maximum efficiency, maximum chaos.

**Elon**: (checking phone) Grok says Korean productivity is top 3 globally...

**Jihyuk**: Because we don't waste time being embarrassed. We just execute.

**Elon**: (nodding slowly) Like shipping code without bugs. Just ship proven code.

**Jihyuk**: NOW you get it.

*[Elevator opens to lobby]*

**Security Guard**: (bowing) 수고하셨습니다!

**Elon**: (bowing back) 수고하셨습니다!

**Jihyuk**: (impressed) See? You're already Level 2 at Korean culture.

**Elon**: (walking out) What level is bathroom cleaning lady acceptance?

**Jihyuk**: (laughing) Level 7 at least.

## Epilogue: The Grok Search

*[That night. Elon in his hotel room, still on Grok]*

**Search History**:
- "Korean bathroom etiquette"
- "Why are Koreans so efficient"
- "Alan Turing von Neumann collaboration"
- "Palladium programming language"
- "How to say 'revolutionary language' in Korean"
- "혁명적인 언어"
- "Mrs. Park cleaning lady Seoul famous"

**Elon**: (to himself) Tomorrow, I'm using the executive bathroom on the 50th floor.

*[Phone buzzes. Message from Jihyuk]*

**Jihyuk**: "BTW, Mrs. Park cleans the 50th floor too. Same time. See you at 9! 😂"

**Elon**: (throwing phone on bed) FUCK!

*[Screen fades to black]*

*Note: This dramatization is based on true events at HAL9 HQ. Mrs. Park has since been promoted to Chief Cleanliness Officer (CCO). She still doesn't care if you're peeing.*
