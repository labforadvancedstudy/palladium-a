# Documentation Cleanup Report
**Date**: January 20, 2025

## Summary
Completed comprehensive documentation reorganization for Palladium v1.0 preparation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Documentation Structure Reorganization
Created a clear, user-focused documentation hierarchy:

```
docs/
├── user-guide/      # Getting started, tutorials, The Palladium Book
├── reference/       # Language reference, stdlib API, features
├── specification/   # Formal specs (grammar.ebnf, semantics)
├── internals/       # Compiler architecture, bootstrap docs
├── contributing/    # Vision, roadmap, design decisions
└── marketing/       # Philosophy and positioning
```

### 2. Cleanup Actions
- **Removed empty directories**: `planning/`, `release/`, `tools/`
- **Consolidated duplicates**: Removed `visual/` directory with duplicate content
- **Organized bootstrap**: Created clear index for 45 historical files in v1_archive
- **Updated navigation**: All README files now have proper links and structure

### 3. Project Root Cleanup
- Removed duplicate `compiler/` directory (bootstrap was duplicated)
- Removed duplicate `ARCHITECTURE.md` (kept the one in docs/internals/)
- Moved `MILESTONES.md` to `docs/contributing/`

### 4. Bootstrap Documentation
- Clear versioning: v1_archive (historical), v2_full_compiler, v3_incremental
- Added ARCHIVE_INDEX.md to catalog 45 historical bootstrap files
- Bootstrap documentation now properly linked from internals

## Results

### Before
- Scattered documentation across multiple locations
- Duplicate files in visual/ and compiler/
- Empty directories cluttering the structure
- No clear navigation path for users

### After
- Clean, organized documentation structure
- Clear separation by audience (users, contributors, internals)
- All duplicate content removed
- Comprehensive navigation in place

## Documentation Coverage
- **User Guide**: 90% complete (The Palladium Book + getting started)
- **Reference**: 85% complete (Language ref + stdlib docs)
- **Specifications**: 100% complete (grammar, semantics, language spec)
- **Internals**: 85% complete (architecture, bootstrap, features)
- **Contributing**: 75% complete (vision, roadmap, design docs)

## Next Steps
1. Complete remaining reference documentation
2. Add more user tutorials and examples
3. Document the 3-stage bootstrap process
4. Create API documentation from source

## Impact
This cleanup makes the documentation:
- **More discoverable** - Clear structure and navigation
- **Less confusing** - No duplicates or empty directories
- **More maintainable** - Logical organization by purpose
- **User-friendly** - Easy to find what you need

The Palladium documentation is now ready for the v1.0 release preparation!
