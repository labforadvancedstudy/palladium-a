# 📊 Palladium Project Status Report
**Date**: 2025-06-16  
**Project**: Palladium Programming Language  
**Version**: v1.0-bootstrap  
**Status**: Self-Hosting Achieved! 🎉

## 🚨 당장 해야할일 (Immediate Tasks)

### Week 1-2: Critical Fixes
1. **String Concatenation** (Priority: HIGH)

   let greeting = "Hello, " + name + "!";
   // Need to implement operator+ for strings
   ```

2. **Module System Basics** (Priority: HIGH)
   ```palladium
   // Need to support:
   import std::vec::Vec;
   import mymodule::MyStruct;
   ```

3. **Generic Functions** (Priority: HIGH)
   ```palladium
   // Currently can't write:
   fn identity<T>(x: T) -> T { x }
   ```

### Week 3-4: Tooling Essentials
1. **Basic Package Manager**
   - Simple dependency resolution
   - Local package support
   - Build command integration

2. **Error Message Improvements**

## 💭 네가 생각하기에 해야할일 (What I Think Should Be Done)

### 1. **Focus on Developer Experience** (Highest Priority)
The language is technically impressive, but developer experience gaps will limit adoption:

- **Better Error Messages**: Current errors are too terse. Need Rust-like helpful diagnostics
- **IDE Support**: At minimum, syntax highlighting and go-to-definition
- **Interactive Tutorial**: A playground website where people can try Palladium
- **Migration Guide**: Help Rust developers transition to Palladium

### 2. **Performance Benchmarking Suite**
Claims of "von Neumann performance" need proof:
- Implement standard benchmarks (binary-trees, spectral-norm, etc.)
- Compare against C, Rust, and Go
- Publish results transparently
- Identify and fix performance bottlenecks

### 3. **Real-World Application**
Build something substantial in Palladium:
- **Web Server**: Prove the language can handle production workloads
- **Database**: Show memory safety without GC works at scale
- **Compiler**: Complete the self-hosting by making pdc feature-complete
- **Game Engine**: Demonstrate real-time performance

### 4. **Community Building**
- **Discord/Forum**: Create spaces for discussion
- **Weekly Blog Posts**: Share development progress
- **Video Tutorials**: Lower the barrier to entry
- **Contributor Guide**: Make it easy for others to help

### 5. **Strategic Decisions Needed**

**Memory Model Clarification**:
- How exactly does "no GC, no leaks" work?
- Need clear documentation on ownership model
- Comparison with Rust's borrow checker

**Async Story**:
- Will it be stackless like Rust or stackful like Go?
- How will it integrate with the type system?
- What about cancellation and timeouts?

**Ecosystem Strategy**:
- Will there be FFI to use C/Rust libraries?
- How will packages be distributed?
- What about binary compatibility?

### 6. **Technical Debt to Address**

**Compiler Architecture**:
- Current single-pass design limits optimizations
- Need proper IR for advanced features
- Consider multi-stage compilation

**Type System Limitations**:
- No higher-kinded types limits expressiveness
- Associated types would enable better APIs
- Const generics for compile-time computation

**Missing Core Features**:
- No way to define custom operators
- No method syntax (everything is functions)
- No way to extend existing types

## 📝 Conclusion

Palladium has achieved an incredible milestone with self-hosting, proving the core language design is sound and complete enough to implement a compiler. The foundation is solid, but significant work remains to make it a production-ready alternative to Rust or C++.

The immediate focus should be on developer experience improvements and filling critical feature gaps (generics, modules, better errors). With dedicated effort over the next 3-6 months, Palladium could become a viable choice for systems programming.

The vision of "Turing's Proofs Meet von Neumann's Performance" is within reach, but execution on the remaining 5% will determine whether Palladium becomes a historical footnote or a revolutionary force in systems programming.

**Key Message**: The hard part (self-hosting) is done. Now comes the harder part: building an ecosystem that attracts and retains developers.
