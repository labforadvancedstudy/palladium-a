## Conclusion

Palladium has proven its core concepts through successful bootstrap. The next 12 months are critical for transforming it from a research project into a production-ready language. With focused execution on these milestones, Palladium can achieve its vision of combining formal verification with systems performance.

**Next Immediate Steps**:
1. Start LLVM backend prototype (Week 1-2)
2. Design trait system syntax (Week 1)
3. Set up CI/CD pipeline (Week 1)
4. Create contribution guidelines (Week 1)
5. Begin async/effects research spike (Week 2-3)

**Critical Path**: LLVM Backend â†’ Traits â†’ Async/Effects â†’ 1.0 Release

The journey from bootstrap to production is challenging but achievable. With the solid foundation already built, Palladium is well-positioned to become a revolutionary systems programming language.
