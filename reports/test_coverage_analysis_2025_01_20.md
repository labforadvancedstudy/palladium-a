   - Trait resolution
   - Generic instantiation
   - Lifetime validation

4. **Code Generator Tests**
   - C backend output validation
   - LLVM IR generation
   - Optimization passes
   - Runtime function calls

### Priority 2: Language Server Protocol (CRITICAL FOR ADOPTION)
The LSP has zero test coverage despite being essential for IDE integration:

1. **LSP Handler Tests**
   - Initialize/shutdown lifecycle
   - Document synchronization
   - Diagnostics publishing
   - Completion requests
   - Hover information
   - Go to definition
   - Find references
   - Rename refactoring

2. **LSP Integration Tests**
   - Multi-file projects
   - Incremental updates
   - Performance under load

### Priority 3: Package Manager (ECOSYSTEM CRITICAL)
Limited testing could lead to dependency management issues:

1. **Dependency Resolution**
   - Version conflict resolution
   - Circular dependency detection
   - Lock file generation/validation

2. **Registry Operations**
   - Package publishing
   - Version querying
   - Authentication

3. **Build System Integration**
   - Multi-package builds
   - Build caching
   - Clean builds

### Priority 4: Advanced Language Features
These features have minimal testing:

1. **Async/Await System**
   - Future trait implementation
   - Async function compilation
   - Await expression handling
   - Async runtime integration

2. **Effects System**
   - Effect declaration and checking
   - Effect inference
   - Effect polymorphism

3. **Macro System**
   - Macro expansion
   - Hygiene rules
   - Recursive macros
   - Built-in macros

   - Follow with parser tests
   - Require tests for all new features

3. **Set Up CI/CD**
   - Automated test runs on commits
   - Coverage reporting
   - Performance regression detection

4. **Establish Testing Culture**
   - No PR without tests policy
   - Regular test review sessions
   - Coverage goals in milestones

## Metrics and Monitoring

### Current Metrics
- **Test Files**: 130+ Palladium test files, 8 Rust test files
- **Test Runners**: 1 basic shell script
- **Coverage**: ~35% (estimated)
- **CI/CD**: None

### Target Metrics (80% Coverage)
- **Unit Tests**: 800+
- **Integration Tests**: 200+
- **E2E Tests**: 50+
- **Coverage**: 80%+ for critical paths
- **CI/CD**: Full automation with coverage gates

## Conclusion

The Palladium project has made impressive progress in language implementation and bootstrap capability, but test coverage is a critical weakness that could impact stability and adoption. The compiler pipeline (lexer, parser, type checker, code generator) and tooling (LSP, package manager) are severely under-tested.

Achieving 80% test coverage will require approximately 6-8 weeks of focused effort, creating 1000+ new tests across unit, integration, and end-to-end categories. This investment is crucial for:

1. **Stability**: Preventing regressions as the language evolves
2. **Adoption**: Giving users confidence in the tooling
3. **Development Speed**: Faster iteration with safety net
4. **Documentation**: Tests serve as executable specifications

The highest priority should be testing the core compiler pipeline, followed by the language server and package manager. These components form the foundation that all other features depend upon.
