# Palladium 1.0 Release Plan - REVISED

## Overview
Based on user feedback, focusing on CORE requirements only:
1. **Documentation** - Complete and organize all documentation
2. **Self-hosting validation** - Rust PD compiler → PD PD compiler → PD PD compiler
3. **Benchmarking** - Performance validation of self-hosted compiler

## Current State
- Bootstrap 100% achieved (June 17, 2025)
- Multiple working compilers in Palladium:
  - `bootstrap/v2_full_compiler/pdc.pd` (1,220 lines)
  - `bootstrap/v3_incremental/tiny_v16.pd` (760 lines) - Most complete

## Core Tasks for 1.0

### Phase 1: Documentation Organization (1 week)
**Goal**: Clean, organized, comprehensive documentation

- [ ] **Consolidate Bootstrap Documentation**
  - [ ] Merge bootstrap directories into clear structure
  - [ ] Document each compiler variant and its capabilities
  - [ ] Create bootstrap history and lessons learned

- [ ] **Language Reference**
  - [ ] Complete syntax reference
  - [ ] Type system documentation
  - [ ] Standard library API docs
  - [ ] Examples for every feature

- [ ] **User Guide**
  - [ ] Getting started guide
  - [ ] Installation instructions
  - [ ] Tutorial from hello world to complex programs
  - [ ] Common patterns and idioms

- [ ] **Architecture Documentation**
  - [ ] Compiler internals guide
  - [ ] Runtime system overview
  - [ ] Code generation process
  - [ ] Module system design

### Phase 2: Self-Hosting Validation (2 weeks)
**Goal**: Prove complete self-hosting with 3-stage bootstrap

- [ ] **Stage 1: Prepare PD Compiler in PD**
  - [ ] Choose best bootstrap compiler (likely tiny_v16.pd)
  - [ ] Ensure it can compile itself
  - [ ] Fix any missing features for self-compilation
  - [ ] Create build scripts for automation

- [ ] **Stage 2: Three-Stage Bootstrap**
  - [ ] Use Rust pdc to compile PD pdc → `pdc1`
  - [ ] Use `pdc1` to compile PD pdc → `pdc2`
  - [ ] Use `pdc2` to compile PD pdc → `pdc3`
  - [ ] Verify `pdc2` and `pdc3` are binary identical

- [ ] **Stage 3: Validation Suite**
  - [ ] Compile test programs with each stage
  - [ ] Verify identical output at each stage
  - [ ] Document any discrepancies
  - [ ] Create automated validation script

### Phase 3: Benchmarking & Performance (1 week)
**Goal**: Measure and document compiler performance

- [ ] **Benchmark Infrastructure**
  - [ ] Create benchmark suite of various programs
  - [ ] Measure compilation time for each stage
  - [ ] Compare Rust pdc vs PD pdc performance
  - [ ] Memory usage profiling

- [ ] **Performance Analysis**
  - [ ] Identify bottlenecks in PD compiler
  - [ ] Document performance characteristics
  - [ ] Create performance regression tests
  - [ ] Set baseline for future improvements

- [ ] **Results Documentation**
  - [ ] Performance comparison report
  - [ ] Optimization opportunities
  - [ ] Future performance roadmap

## Implementation Strategy

1. **No New Features** - Focus only on validation and documentation
2. **Use Existing Code** - Work with current bootstrap compilers
3. **Simple Scripts** - Automate validation with basic shell scripts
4. **Clear Documentation** - Every step must be documented

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All documentation organized and complete
- [ ] Three-stage bootstrap passes with identical binaries
- [ ] Performance within 10x of Rust compiler (acceptable for v1.0)
- [ ] Automated validation scripts work on Linux/macOS
- [ ] Clear instructions for users to reproduce bootstrap

## Timeline

- **Week 1**: Documentation organization
- **Week 2-3**: Self-hosting validation
- **Week 4**: Benchmarking and final cleanup
- **Target**: v1.0 release in 4 weeks

## Review Section
(To be completed as work progresses)

### Changes Made
- [x] Documentation reorganization completed
  - Created clear structure: user-guide, reference, specification, internals, contributing
  - Removed empty directories (planning, release, tools)
  - Consolidated visual documentation duplicates
  - Updated all README files with proper navigation
  - Created index for v1 archive (45 historical files)
- [x] Project cleanup
  - Removed duplicate compiler/ directory
  - Moved ARCHITECTURE.md duplicate
  - Moved MILESTONES.md to docs/contributing/
  - Organized bootstrap documentation with clear versioning

### Lessons Learned
- [ ] To be updated...

### Future Work (Post 1.0)
- [ ] Performance optimizations
- [ ] Additional platform support
- [ ] Advanced language features
