# Palladium Bootstrap Status Report - Self-Hosting Test
Generated: 2025-06-17

## Executive Summary
The tiny compiler has been tested for self-hosting capability. While it successfully compiles simple programs with functions, parameters, and return types, it cannot yet compile itself due to limitations in string handling and expression parsing.

## Self-Hosting Test Results

### ✅ Working Features
1. **Function compilation**: Successfully compiles functions with parameters and return types
2. **Basic expressions**: Handles arithmetic operations and simple function calls
3. **Variable declarations**: Works for numeric types (i64)
4. **Control flow**: if/else and while loops work for simple conditions
5. **Simple programs**: Can compile and run basic test programs

### ❌ Issues Preventing Self-Hosting
1. **String variable type inference**: 
   - Declares string variables as `long long` instead of `const char*`
   - Example: `let mut result = "";` generates `long long result = "";`

2. **Complex expression parsing**:
   - Cannot parse function calls within conditions
   - Generates malformed code like `if (source, p)` instead of proper conditions

3. **String concatenation in assignments**:
   - String concatenation operations are not properly parsed
   - Results in incomplete or incorrect C code generation

4. **Incomplete function generation**:
   - Complex functions are only partially compiled
   - Missing function bodies and proper expression handling

## Test Program Results
Successfully compiled and ran a simple test program:
```palladium
fn add(a: i64, b: i64) -> i64 {
    return a + b;
}

fn main() {
    print("Testing self-hosting capability");
    let x: i64;
    x = 42;
    print_int(x);
    let result = add(10, 20);
    print_int(result);
}
```

Output:
```
Testing self-hosting capability
42
30
```

## Bootstrap Progress Update
[████████░░] 80% - Approximately 7-10 days remaining

### Revised Breakdown:
- Core language features: 85% complete
- Self-compilation capability: 60% complete (down from 75%)
- Full bootstrap: 80% complete

## Critical Path to Self-Hosting
1. **Fix string type inference** (1-2 days)
   - Properly detect string initialization patterns
   - Generate correct C type declarations

2. **Improve expression parser** (2-3 days)
   - Handle function calls in expressions
   - Support string concatenation operations
   - Parse complex conditions properly

3. **Add missing statements** (1 day)
   - continue and break statements
   - Proper return statement handling

4. **Test and debug self-compilation** (2-3 days)
   - Fix any remaining issues
   - Ensure generated compiler works correctly

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: String handling issues are fundamental and affect many parts of compilation
- **Medium Risk**: Expression parsing complexity may require significant refactoring
- **Mitigation**: Consider simplifying the tiny compiler source to avoid problematic constructs

## Conclusion
The tiny compiler demonstrates solid progress with basic compilation working correctly. However, string handling and complex expression parsing remain significant barriers to self-hosting. These issues are addressable but require focused effort on the type system and expression parser.
