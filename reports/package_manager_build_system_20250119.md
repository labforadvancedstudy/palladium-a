# Package Manager and Build System - January 19, 2025

## Summary

Successfully implemented a comprehensive package manager (pdm) and build system for Palladium, providing modern dependency management and build orchestration capabilities. The system includes CLI tools, dependency resolution, incremental builds, and test infrastructure.

## Architecture Overview

### 1. Package Manager (`src/package/`)
- **PackageManifest**: Package metadata and dependencies
- **PackageManager**: Core package management logic
- **Dependency Resolution**: Version-based dependency management
- **Registry Support**: Foundation for package registry

### 2. Build System (`src/package/build.rs`)
- **BuildContext**: Tracks dependencies and artifacts
- **Incremental Builds**: Only rebuilds changed files
- **Parallel Compilation**: Multi-core support
- **Target Management**: Debug/release modes
- **LLVM Support**: Optional LLVM backend

### 3. CLI Tool (`pdm`)
- **User-friendly Interface**: Intuitive commands
- **Comprehensive Commands**: new, init, build, run, test, etc.
- **Flexible Options**: Release mode, verbosity, features
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages

## Implementation Details

### Package Manifest Format

```
name = "hello_pdm"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "A Palladium package"
authors = ["John Doe <john@example.com>"]
license = "MIT"

[dependencies]
std = "1.0"
http = { version = "0.2", features = ["client"] }

[dev-dependencies]
test_framework = "0.5"
```

### Build System Features

1. **Dependency Graph**: Topological sorting for build order
2. **Artifact Caching**: Tracks modification times
3. **Incremental Builds**: Skips unchanged files
4. **Multiple Targets**: Libraries, binaries, tests
5. **Cross-compilation**: Foundation for target support

### CLI Commands

```bash
# Create new package
pdm new my_package

# Initialize in current directory
pdm init

# Build package
pdm build [--release] [--llvm] [--verbose]

# Run package
pdm run [--release] [args...]

# Run tests
pdm test [filter] [--release]

# Add dependency
pdm add serde "1.0"

# Clean build artifacts
pdm clean
```

## Usage Examples

### Creating a New Package

```bash
$ pdm new awesome_app
✅ Created package 'awesome_app' at awesome_app

$ cd awesome_app
$ ls
package.pd  src/

$ cat package.pd
name = "awesome_app"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "A new Palladium package"
authors = ["GShock <icedac@gmail.com>"]
license = "MIT"
```

### Building and Running

```bash
$ pdm build --verbose
🏗️  Building 1 package(s)
📦 Building package 'awesome_app'
   🔨 Compiling src/main.pd
✅ Build completed in 0.12s

$ pdm run
🚀 Running awesome_app
─────────────────────────────────────
Hello from awesome_app!
─────────────────────────────────────
```

### Running Tests

```bash
$ pdm test
🧪 Running tests...
Found 3 test(s)
test test_math ... ✅ ok
test test_string ... ✅ ok
test test_collections ... ✅ ok

Test results: 3 passed, 0 failed
```

## Build Process

### 1. Dependency Resolution
- Load package manifest
- Resolve dependencies recursively
- Build dependency graph
- Check for circular dependencies

### 2. Build Order
- Topological sort of dependency graph
- Build dependencies first
- Cache built artifacts

### 3. Compilation
- Check if rebuild needed (timestamp comparison)
- Use appropriate backend (C or LLVM)
- Generate artifacts in target directory

### 4. Linking
- For executables: Link with gcc/clang
- For libraries: Create archive
- Handle platform-specific requirements

## Directory Structure

```
my_package/
├── package.pd           # Package manifest
├── src/
│   ├── main.pd         # Main entry point
│   └── lib.pd          # Library entry point
├── tests/              # Test files
│   └── test_*.pd
├── examples/           # Example programs
├── benches/           # Benchmarks
└── target/            # Build output
    ├── debug/         # Debug builds
    │   └── deps/      # Dependencies
    └── release/       # Release builds
```

## Integration with Compiler

The package manager integrates seamlessly with the Palladium compiler:

1. **Driver Usage**: Uses the compiler driver for builds
2. **Error Reporting**: Leverages compiler's error reporting
3. **Optimization**: Respects compiler optimization flags
4. **Backend Selection**: Supports both C and LLVM backends

## Performance Features

1. **Incremental Builds**: Only recompile changed files
2. **Parallel Compilation**: Use multiple CPU cores
3. **Artifact Caching**: Track build artifacts
4. **Dependency Caching**: Cache resolved dependencies
5. **Minimal Rebuilds**: Smart dependency tracking

## Future Enhancements

### Package Registry
- Central package repository
- Version resolution
- Package publishing
- Security scanning

### Advanced Features
- Workspace support (monorepos)
- Custom build scripts
- Cross-compilation targets
- Binary caching
- Dependency vendoring

### Tooling Integration
- IDE integration via LSP
- Continuous integration support
- Documentation generation
- Code coverage reports

## Testing

Created comprehensive test coverage:
- Unit tests for package manager
- Integration tests for build system
- CLI command tests
- Example packages for validation

## Comparison with Other Package Managers

### Similar to Cargo (Rust)
- Manifest format
- Command structure
- Build process

### Similar to npm (JavaScript)
- Dependency management
- Registry concept
- Script running

### Unique Features
- Effect system integration
- Native LLVM support
- Palladium-specific optimizations

## Conclusion

The package manager and build system provide a modern, efficient development experience for Palladium programmers. Key achievements:

- ✅ **Intuitive CLI**: Easy to learn and use
- ✅ **Fast Builds**: Incremental compilation
- ✅ **Dependency Management**: Version-aware resolution
- ✅ **Test Integration**: Built-in test runner
