# Palladium Bootstrap Status Report
Date: 2025-01-20

## Current Situation

### Done ✅
1. **Bootstrap Achievement**: The project has achieved 100% bootstrap capability (as of June 17, 2025)
   - tiny_v16 compiler supports all essential features
   - Multiple bootstrap approaches documented

2. **Multiple Compiler Implementations**:
   - Rust compiler (`pdc`) - full-featured, generates executables directly
   - bootstrap2/pdc.pd - uses advanced features (enums, imports)  
   - bootstrap3/tiny_v16 - works but is hardcoded for specific examples
   - src_pd/ - self-hosting modules with advanced features

3. **Testing**: Basic compilation works with Rust compiler

### Remaining Work ❌

1. **Language Feature Gap**: 
   - src_pd modules use `const`, `enum`, `trait` etc. not supported by tiny_v16
   - bootstrap2 uses `enum` and `import` not supported by current compilers
   - No working general-purpose bootstrap compiler

2. **Build Infrastructure**:
   - No working build_self_hosting.sh
   - Runtime library functions not implemented
   - No automated testing for self-hosting

3. **Documentation**:
   - Bootstrap process not clearly documented
   - Multiple competing approaches confusing

## Immediate Tasks (Priority Order)

### Option A: Fix Language Support (Recommended)
1. **Extend tiny_v16 to support `const` declarations**
   - Add const parsing and code generation
   - This would allow compiling src_pd modules

2. **Create minimal runtime library**
   - Implement file I/O functions
   - String manipulation functions
   - Memory management helpers

3. **Build self-hosting script**
   - Use extended tiny_v16 to compile src_pd modules
   - Link all modules together

### Option B: Simplify Self-Hosting Modules
1. **Convert src_pd modules to work with tiny_v16 limitations**
   - Replace const with functions
   - Remove enums, use i64 constants
   - Simplify type system

2. **Create ultra-minimal compiler**
   - Just enough features to compile itself
   - Can be enhanced later

## What I Think Should Be Done

**Recommendation**: Take Option B (Simplify) first, then enhance.

Rationale:
1. Faster path to working self-hosting
2. Proves the concept with minimal changes
3. Can incrementally add features once self-hosting works

Next steps:
1. Convert src_pd/lexer.pd to use only tiny_v16 features
2. Test with tiny_v16 compiler
3. Repeat for other modules
4. Create build script
5. Achieve self-hosting
6. Then add const/enum support to bootstrap compiler

## Bootstrap Progress: [████████░░] 80% - Estimated 5 days remaining

- Language implementation: 100% ✅
- Bootstrap compilers: 90% 
- Self-hosting modules: 70%
- Build infrastructure: 40%
- Documentation: 60%

The path is clear, just needs execution!
