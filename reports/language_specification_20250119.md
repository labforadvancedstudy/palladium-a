# Formal Language Specification - January 19, 2025

## Summary

Successfully created a comprehensive formal specification for the Palladium programming language, including syntax specification, semantic rules, grammar definition, and detailed behavioral specifications. This establishes Palladium as a professionally-designed language with clear, unambiguous rules.

## Specification Components

### 1. Main Language Specification (`docs/language_specification.md`)

The core specification document covering:

#### Structure
1. **Introduction**: Design goals and terminology
2. **Notation**: EBNF and lexical notation conventions  
3. **Lexical Structure**: Tokens, keywords, literals, operators
4. **Syntax**: Complete syntactic rules
5. **Type System**: Type categories, inference, safety
6. **Memory Model**: Ownership, borrowing, layout
7. **Execution Model**: Control flow, pattern matching, effects
8. **Standard Library**: Prelude and core modules
9. **Appendices**: Reserved words, undefined behavior, limits

#### Key Features Specified
- Unicode source code (UTF-8)
- Context-free grammar
- Strong static typing with inference
- Memory safety without GC
- Effect system
- Pattern matching
- Async/await support

### 2. Formal Grammar (`docs/grammar.ebnf`)

Complete EBNF grammar specification:

#### Lexical Grammar
- Whitespace and comments
- Identifiers and keywords
- Literals (integer, string, boolean)
- Operators and punctuation
- Delimiters

#### Syntactic Grammar
- Program structure
- Item definitions (functions, structs, enums, traits)
- Type syntax
- Statement forms
- Expression hierarchy
- Pattern matching
- Control flow constructs

#### Operator Precedence
Clearly defined 16-level precedence hierarchy from paths/literals (highest) to return/break/continue (lowest).

### 3. Semantic Specification (`docs/semantics.md`)

Detailed semantic rules covering:

#### Core Semantics
1. **Name Resolution**: Scoping, lookup order, shadowing
2. **Type Checking**: Bidirectional algorithm, subtyping, coercion
3. **Ownership**: Move semantics, borrowing rules, lifetime inference
4. **Memory Management**: Allocation, deallocation, safety invariants
5. **Control Flow**: Evaluation order, pattern matching, loops

#### Advanced Features
6. **Function Calls**: Calling convention, method resolution, generics
7. **Traits**: Implementation, bounds, associated types
8. **Effects System**: Inference, polymorphism, async integration
9. **Const Evaluation**: Compile-time computation
10. **Unsafe Code**: Operations, invariants, undefined behavior

#### System Integration
11. **Module System**: Resolution, visibility, imports
12. **Macros**: Expansion, hygiene
13. **Error Handling**: Result type, ? operator, panics
14. **Concurrency**: Send/Sync, data race prevention
15. **Standard Library**: Lang items, intrinsics
