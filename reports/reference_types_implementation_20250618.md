# Reference Types Implementation Report
Date: 2025-06-18

## Summary
Successfully implemented basic reference types (&T, &mut T) in the Palladium Rust compiler (pdc(rust)).

## What Was Implemented

### 1. AST Changes
- Added `Reference` variant to `Type` enum with lifetime, mutability, and inner type
- Added `Reference` and `Deref` variants to `Expr` enum  
- Added `Deref` variant to `AssignTarget` enum for assignment through references

### 2. Lexer Changes
- Added `Ampersand` token for & operator
- Added `SingleQuote` token for lifetime annotations (future use)

### 3. Parser Changes
- Updated `parse_type` to handle reference types: `&T`, `&mut T`, `&'a T`
- Updated `parse_unary` to handle & (reference) and * (dereference) operators
- Updated `parse_statement` to support assignment through dereference: `*ptr = value`

### 4. Type Checker Changes
- Added basic support for Reference and Deref expressions
- Reference types currently simplified to inner type (proper reference typing TODO)

### 5. Borrow Checker Changes
- Added handling for `Reference` expressions - creates borrows
- Added handling for `Deref` assignment targets
- Tracks immutable vs mutable borrows

### 6. Code Generator Changes
- References compile to C pointers: `&T` → `T*`
- Reference expressions compile to address-of: `&x` → `&(x)`
- Dereference expressions compile to pointer dereference: `*x` → `*(x)`
- Dereference assignments compile correctly: `*ptr = val` → `*(ptr) = val`

## Test Results

### Working Example
```palladium
fn main() {
    // Immutable reference
    let x: i32 = 42;
    let ref_x: &i32 = &x;
    
    // Mutable reference
    let mut y: i32 = 10;
    let ref_y: &mut i32 = &mut y;
    *ref_y = 20;
    
    print_int(42);
}
```

This compiles successfully and generates correct C code.

### Known Issues

1. **Borrow Checker Too Strict**: Some valid reference patterns trigger "conflicting borrows" errors
2. **No Lifetime Inference**: Lifetimes must be managed manually
3. **Limited Type Checking**: Reference types not fully integrated into type system
4. **No Reference Counting**: Memory management still manual

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Lifetime Annotations** (TODO #183)
   - Parse lifetime parameters on functions
   - Track lifetime constraints
   - Implement lifetime inference

2. **Improve Borrow Checker**
   - Better scope handling
   - Allow re-borrowing after scope ends
   - Better error messages with locations

3. **Full Reference Type Checking**
   - Ensure type safety for references
   - Prevent mismatched reference types
   - Handle reference coercions

4. **Memory Safety Guarantees**
   - Prevent use-after-free
   - Prevent double-free
   - Ensure proper cleanup

## Code Quality
- All tests pass
- Minimal warnings (unused fields in borrow checker)
- Clean integration with existing compiler phases

## Conclusion
Basic reference types are now functional in pdc(rust). The implementation provides a foundation for Rust-like memory safety, though significant work remains on lifetimes and advanced borrow checking scenarios.
