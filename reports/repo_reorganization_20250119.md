# Repository Reorganization Report
*Date: January 19, 2025*

## Summary

Successfully reorganized the Palladium repository structure for better clarity and maintainability.

## Changes Made

### 1. Compiler Organization
Created unified `compiler/` directory with three subdirectories:

```
compiler/
├── rust/          # Production Rust compiler (moved from /src)
├── palladium/     # Self-hosting compiler (moved from /src_pd)
└── bootstrap/     # Bootstrap compilers (moved from /bootstrap)
```

### 2. Development Tools
Created `tools/` directory structure for future development tools:

```
tools/
├── pdfmt/         # Code formatter (planned)
├── pdlint/        # Linter (planned)
└── pddoc/         # Documentation generator (planned)
```

### 3. Benchmarks
Created `benchmarks/` directory for performance tracking:

```
benchmarks/
├── palladium/     # Palladium implementations
├── c/             # C equivalents for comparison
├── rust/          # Rust equivalents for comparison
└── results/       # Benchmark results and analysis
```

### 4. Documentation Updates
- Created `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Main architecture document
- Created `compiler/README.md` - Compiler implementations guide
- Created `benchmarks/README.md` - Benchmark suite documentation
- Created `tools/README.md` - Development tools overview
- Updated `Makefile` - Fixed paths for new structure

## Benefits

1. **Clearer Organization**: Each major component has its own top-level directory
2. **Better Separation**: Compilers are clearly separated by implementation language
3. **Future-Ready**: Structure supports planned tools and benchmarks
4. **Easier Navigation**: Developers can quickly find relevant code

## Migration Notes

### For Developers
- Rust compiler source is now in `compiler/rust/`
- Self-hosting compiler is in `compiler/palladium/`
- Build commands remain the same (Makefile handles path changes)

### For CI/CD
- Update paths in CI scripts to use new locations
- Main build target: `compiler/rust/`

## Next Steps

1. Update remaining build scripts to use new paths
2. Consolidate scattered test files into unified test directory
3. Clean up legacy directories after verification
4. Update documentation references to new paths

## Status

✅ Repository reorganization completed successfully. The new structure provides a solid foundation for the next phase of development: LLVM backend implementation and trait system design.
