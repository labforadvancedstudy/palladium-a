# Project Status Report - Structs Added!

**Date:** 2025-06-17  
**Milestone:** Struct Support Added to Compiler

## 🎯 Progress Update

### Completed Today
1. **Cleaned up versioned files**
   - Moved tiny_v1 through tiny_v16 to archive
   - Now using single `tiny_compiler.pd` file
   - Proper Git versioning going forward

2. **Added struct support**
   - ✅ Struct declaration parsing
   - ✅ Struct type recognition in variables  
   - ✅ C typedef generation
   - 🔄 Field access parsing (in progress)

3. **Project organization**
   - Reduced root folder from 45 to 25 items
   - Created Makefile and build.sh
   - Reorganized bootstrap directories

## 📊 Bootstrap Progress

**Current Status:** Moving beyond 100% - Adding advanced features

```
Basic Bootstrap:  [██████████] 100% ✅
Struct Support:   [████░░░░░░] 40% 🔄  
Module System:    [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%  📅
Self-Hosting:     [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%  📅
```

## 🏗️ Current Compiler Features

### tiny_compiler.pd (was tiny_v16.pd)
- Functions with parameters ✅
- Variables (i64, bool, String) ✅  
- Arrays (fixed-size) ✅
- Control flow (if/else, while) ✅
- All operators ✅
- String operations ✅
- File I/O ✅
- **Structs (NEW!)** 🆕
  - Struct declarations ✅
  - Struct types in variables ✅
  - Field access parsing 🔄

## 🐛 Known Issues
1. Struct variable declarations have spacing issues
   - "Point; p;" instead of "Point p;"
2. Array initialization still outputs duplicate syntax
3. Struct field access not yet implemented

## 📅 Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week)
1. Fix struct variable declaration output
2. Implement struct field access (p.x, p.y)
3. Test struct instantiation
4. Add struct literal support

### Short Term (Next 2 Weeks)  
1. Module system
2. Import statements
3. Multiple file compilation

### Medium Term (Next Month)
1. Make compiler self-hosting
2. Remove Rust dependency
3. Full Palladium-in-Palladium compiler

## 💡 Lessons Learned
- Don't create versioned files (v1, v2, v16)
- Use Git for version control
- One file, many commits

## 🎯 Goal
Create a Palladium compiler written entirely in Palladium that can compile itself without any external dependencies.

**Progress toward goal:** ~60% (structs are a major milestone!)
