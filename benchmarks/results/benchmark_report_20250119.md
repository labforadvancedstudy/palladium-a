# Palladium Performance Benchmark Report
**Date**: January 19, 2025  
**Version**: v0.8-alpha

## Executive Summary

Current benchmarks show compilation issues that need to be resolved before accurate performance measurements can be taken. The compiler successfully compiles simple programs but encounters issues with more complex benchmark code.

## Test Results

### 1. Fibonacci (Recursive)
- **C version**: 0.502s ‚úÖ
- **Palladium (C backend)**: Compilation failed ‚ùå
- **Palladium (LLVM backend)**: LLVM tools not available ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Issue**: Missing print function definitions in benchmark code.

### 2. Matrix Multiplication
- **C version**: 0.234s ‚úÖ
- **Palladium**: Compilation failed ‚ùå

**Issue**: Parser error - likely due to array syntax not fully supported.

### 3. String Concatenation
- **C version**: 0.233s ‚úÖ
- **Palladium**: Compilation failed ‚ùå

**Issue**: Borrow checker error - string operations need proper lifetime handling.

### 4. Bubble Sort
- **C version**: 0.232s ‚úÖ
- **Palladium**: Compilation failed ‚ùå

**Issue**: Code generation error - array operations not fully implemented.

## Compiler Status

### Working Features ‚úÖ
- Basic arithmetic operations
- While loops
- Function calls
- Simple I/O (print, print_int)
- Variable declarations and mutations
- Control flow (if/else)

### Issues Found üîß
1. **Missing standard functions**: Benchmark code uses undefined `print` function
2. **Array operations**: Full array support not implemented in codegen
3. **String operations**: Complex string manipulations fail borrow checking
4. **LLVM toolchain**: Not properly configured for benchmarking

## Performance Analysis

Based on the simple test program that compiled successfully:
- Compilation time: ~1s (reasonable for debug build)
- Generated C code quality: Good, with proper optimizations
- Binary execution: Fast and correct

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Fix benchmark code**: Add proper imports/definitions for print functions
2. **Complete array support**: Implement full array operations in codegen
3. **Configure LLVM**: Set up proper LLVM toolchain for native benchmarks
4. **Create simpler benchmarks**: Start with basic operations that work

### Performance Goals
- Target: Within 10% of C performance
- Focus areas: Function calls, loops, arithmetic
- Optimization opportunities: Inline functions, loop unrolling

## Next Steps

1. Create working benchmark suite with supported features
2. Implement missing array and string operations
3. Set up automated performance tracking
4. Add LLVM optimization passes

## Conclusion

While the compiler shows promise with successful compilation of simple programs, the benchmark suite reveals gaps in language feature support. Once these are addressed, Palladium should achieve performance competitive with C, especially with LLVM backend optimizations.

The path to production-ready performance is clear:
1. Complete language feature implementation
2. Fix compilation issues in benchmarks
3. Enable LLVM optimizations
4. Measure and iterate on performance

Current estimate: 2-3 weeks to achieve full benchmark suite execution with target performance.
