# The Alan von Palladium Book

*A Feynman-style guide to understanding Palladium*

> "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough."  
> ‚Äî Often attributed to Einstein, but lived by Feynman

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: This book is being updated for Palladium v0.1.1 (Alpha). Some advanced features described in later chapters are not yet implemented.

## How to Read This Book

This isn't your typical programming language book. We won't start with syntax or grammar rules. Instead, we'll start with problems‚Äîreal problems that programmers face every day‚Äîand discover how Palladium solves them.

Like Feynman teaching physics, we'll use:
- **Simple analogies** that a child could understand
- **Concrete examples** before abstract concepts  
- **Working code** that you can run and modify
- **"What if?" questions** to explore ideas
- **No jargon** until we've earned it

## Running the Examples

All examples in Part I (Fundamentals) work with the current compiler:

```bash
# Install Palladium
cargo install alan-von-palladium

# Run an example
pdc compile example.pd -o example
./build_output/example
```

Examples in later chapters may include features not yet implemented. These are marked with ‚ö†Ô∏è.

## Who This Book Is For

- **Curious programmers** who want to understand, not just memorize
- **Students** learning their first systems language
- **Experienced developers** seeking a fresh perspective
- **Anyone** who's ever wondered "Why is programming so hard?"

## The Feynman Method

Throughout this book, we'll use Feynman's teaching method:

1. **Explain it to a child** - If you can't, you don't understand it
2. **Show working examples** - Code that actually runs
3. **Identify gaps** - Where does the explanation break down?
4. **Simplify** - Remove unnecessary complexity
