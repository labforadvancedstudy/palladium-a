# 🎉 Palladium v0.1-alpha Release Notes

**"The journey to 100/100 begins with Hello World!"**

## 🚀 Mission Accomplished!

We are thrilled to announce the first alpha release of Palladium - a revolutionary programming language that brings together Turing's proofs and von Neumann's performance.

### ✅ What We've Achieved

#### Core Features
- **Basic Lexer & Parser**: Tokenizes and parses Palladium source code
- **Type System**: Minimal type checking for functions and basic types
- **Code Generation**: Generates C code (LLVM support coming in v0.2)
- **CLI Compiler**: Full command-line interface with compile and run commands
- **Standard Library**: Basic `print` function for output

#### Language Support
- Function definitions with return types (`fn main() -> i32`)
- String literals
- Function calls
- Comments (single-line and multi-line)
- Main function as entry point

#### Developer Experience
- Clear, helpful error messages
- ASCII art banner for style points
- Compile and run in one command
- Cross-platform support (macOS, Linux)

### 📊 By The Numbers
- **Lines of Code**: ~2,500
- **Test Coverage**: 53 tests passing
- **Compilation Time**: < 1 second for small programs
- **Zero Dependencies**: Only standard Rust crates

### 🎯 Success Metrics Achieved
- ✅ `hello.pd` compiles without errors
- ✅ Generated binary runs and prints message
- ✅ Compiler gives helpful errors for invalid syntax
- ✅ Basic test suite passes (53 tests)
- ✅ Documentation allows new contributors to understand code

### 📝 Example Programs

#### Hello World
```palladium
fn main() -> i32 {
    print("Hello, World!");
    return 0;
}
```

#### Greetings
```palladium
fn main() -> i32 {
    print("Welcome to the future of programming!");
    print("Where Legends Compile!");
    return 0;
}
```

### 🛠️ Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/avp/palladium
cd palladium

# Build the compiler
cargo build --release

# Run your first program
./target/release/pdc run examples/hello.pd
```

### 🔮 What's Next (v0.2)

- Variables and let bindings
- Integer arithmetic
- Control flow (if/else)
- LLVM backend for native code generation
- Type inference basics
- More built-in functions

### 👏 Acknowledgments

This release represents the first step in our journey to create a language that doesn't compromise between safety and performance, between expressiveness and verifiability.

Special thanks to the Rust community for providing such excellent tools and libraries that made this bootstrap possible.

### 🐛 Known Limitations

- No variables or arithmetic yet
- Only string literals supported
- No control flow constructs
- C backend only (no direct machine code)
- Limited to single-file programs
