## How to Read This Book

This isn't your typical programming language book. We won't start with syntax or grammar rules. Instead, we'll start with problemsâ€”real problems that programmers face every dayâ€”and discover how Palladium solves them.

Like Feynman teaching physics, we'll use:
- **Simple analogies** that a child could understand
- **Concrete examples** before abstract concepts  
- **Pictures and diagrams** because seeing is understanding
- **"What if?" questions** to explore ideas
- **No jargon** until we've earned it

## Who This Book Is For

- **Curious programmers** who want to understand, not just memorize
- **Students** learning their first systems language
- **Experienced developers** seeking a fresh perspective
- **Anyone** who's ever wondered "Why is programming so hard?"

## The Feynman Method

Throughout this book, we'll use Feynman's teaching method:

1. **Explain it to a child** - If you can't, you don't understand it
2. **Identify gaps** - Where does the explanation break down?
3. **Go back to the source** - Fill in the gaps
4. **Simplify** - Remove unnecessary complexity
