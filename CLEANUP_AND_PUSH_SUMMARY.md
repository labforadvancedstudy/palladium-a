# 🎉 Bootstrap Achievement Committed and Pushed!

## What Just Happened

### 1. 🧹 Cleaned Up Root Directory
**Before**: Root was cluttered with 14+ temporary files
**After**: Clean and organized

**Removed**:
- 8 executable files (bootstrap_demo, demo, final, output, parsed, program, typed, test_program)
- 6 temporary files (test_file.txt, type_report.txt, etc.)

**Moved**:

- Demo files → `examples/demo/` directory

### 2. 📝 Enhanced .gitignore

/demo
/final
/output
# ... and many more
```
